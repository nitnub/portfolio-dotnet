# portfolio-dotnet
A Portfolio page built in .NET. This will serve as the primary landing page to share projects I've been working on. This project consists of two sections:
## Guest Area
This section houses a brief introduction and cards showing individual projects with links to demos, videos, and GitHub resources.
## Admin Area
This section allows me to administer the Guest Area. From here, I can add and modify projects, links, multimedia files, and technology icons. I can also show / hide projects as appropriate.
